      <h2 class="section_title">The Early Years of Hayao Miyazaki</h2><br>
      <p>Hayao was born on January 5, 1941 at Bunkyo ward, located in Japan’s capital city, Tokyo. Hayao Miyazaki started his
        elementary education at an institution in Utsonomiya city and later moved to various other schools such as ‘Eifuku
        Elementary School’ and ‘Omiya Junior High’.</p><br>
      <p>Since a really young age Hayao was interested in ‘Manga’, a Japanese style of comic. He started reading a lot of these
        books as a kid and even dreamt of authoring a work of the same kind someday.</p><br>
      <p>While studying at the ‘Toyotama High School’, Miyazaki happened to watch the animated movie ‘The Tales of The White
        Serpent’ and was captivated and fascinated by the actress who played the lead and the film as a whole.</p>

      <h2 class="section_title">How Hayao's Epic Adventure Began</h2><br>
      <p lang="fr">Hayao started pursuing his dream, of making a career in animation, in 1963, he joined the Japanese animation
        giant, ‘Toei Animation Pvt Ltd’. During his time there, Miyazaki got to work on projects like ‘Wolf Boy Ken’ and ‘Watchdog
        Bow Bow’. The animator earned the praises of the ‘Toei’ workers, after he improved the script of their project ‘Gulliver
        Travels To The Moon’ and became successful in arriving at a convincing end to its story.</p><br>
      <p>Even during the 1990’s Hayao mesmerized lovers of manga through his works. His works such as ‘Porco Rosso’ and ‘Princess
        Mononoke’ were considered to be a deviation from his earlier works and were well-appreciated by everyone. Although
        Miyazaki had retired by the end of the decade, he returned to direction in 2004 through the fantasy film ‘Howl’s
        Moving Castle’. This animation icon took over the project after its original director Mamoru Hosuda passed away.
        The movie went on to become a well-acclaimed piece of work.</p><br>
      <p>After a 3-year hiatus from filmmaking, Hayao surfaced with a project named ‘Gake no ue no ponyo’. This feature-length
        film, which was released in 2008, was well-received and grossed approximately $200 million at the box-office. This
        iconic director then worked on the screenplay of the movie ‘The Secret World of Arrietty’, which reached the audiences
        during mid-2010. He also worked as a screenwriter on a film titled ‘From up on Puppy’, which released the very next
        year. Hayao’s last directorial venture was the film titled ‘The Wind Rises’, which released in 2013. The film dealt
        with a series of events which occurred during World War II.</p>
